# Meta-cookiecutter - a cookiecutter for cookiecutters!

This is a template repository for the [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) project
that allows you to quickly set up your own cookiecutters!

This is similar to [cookiecutter-template](https://github.com/eviweb/cookiecutter-template), but up-to-date
and with some tweaks to my needs.

# Prerequisites

Meta-cookiecutter only requires [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) itself, which can be installed with:

```
pip install cookiecutter
```

# Create your own cookiecutter

You can simply try meta-cookiecutter by doing:

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/dokempf/meta-cookiecutter.git
```

Answering all questions on the prompt will create a cookiecutter
that is ready to be customized for your use case.

# Documentation

For a reference of options provided by meta-cookiecutter, check out
[the meta-cookiecutter documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/meta-cookiecutter/badge/?version=latest).
