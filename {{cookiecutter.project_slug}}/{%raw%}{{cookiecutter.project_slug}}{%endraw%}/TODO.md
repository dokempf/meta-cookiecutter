The following tasks need to be done to get a fully working project:

{% if cookiecutter.git_setup == "Yes" -%}
{% raw -%}
{% if cookiecutter.remote_url == 'None' -%}
* Set up a remote repository. You can e.g. create a project in GitHub or GitLab and run
  the following commands in your locally generated project folder: `git remote add origin <Remote-URL>`
  For a seamless integration, the name of the project should also be `{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}`.
{%- else -%}
* Push to your remote repository for the first time by doing `git push origin main`.
{%- endif %}
{%- endraw %}
